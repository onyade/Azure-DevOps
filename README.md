# Azure-DevOps
This repository contains YAML-based pipeline examples that demonstrate how to set up continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines using Azure DevOps. Our pipelines show best practices for building, testing, and deploying applications using Azure DevOps services such as Azure Pipelines, Azure Repos, and Azure Artifacts.

code samples cover a range of topics, including:

*Building and testing .NET Core, Node.js, and Python applications

*Deploying to Kubernetes clusters using Helm charts

*Deploying to Azure App Service and Azure Functions

*Using infrastructure as code tools such as Terraform and ARM templates

*Configuring environment-specific settings using Azure Key Vault and Azure DevOps variable groups
